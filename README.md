# wodlog

A tool for users to input Work Out of the Day (WOD). Their WOD input would include the exercise, the repetitions, the sets, and the weight. From these information, the system could derive some trends. In particular, the system could derive 1RM for each exercise. The system could also easily advise the users target weights based on the 1RM calculated from the trend.

The intent is for this tool to be available both for web and for mobile.
